My name is Raquel. I'm a web developer who is obsessed with WordPress and also fascinated by data analysis.
I'm currently working on earning a MS in Data Analytics from Western Governors University.
I'm currently learning how to do time series, as well as sentiment analysis.
Fun fact: before earning my BS in Web Design & Development, I taught myself web development by reading HTML For Dummies. Greatest book ever (at the time).
