- My name is Raquel. I'm a web developer who is obsessed with WordPress and also fascinated by data analysis.
- I just earned a MS in Data Analytics from Western Governors University (June 2024).
- Fun fact: before earning my BS in Web Design & Development, I taught myself web development by reading [HTML For Dummies](https://ebay.us/f7zoun). Greatest book ever (at the time).
