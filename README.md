- My name is Raquel. I'm a web developer who is obsessed with WordPress and also fascinated by data analysis.
- I'm currently working on earning a MS in Data Analytics from Western Governors University.
- Right now I'm working on the graduate capstone (thesis) project. I'm analyzing stock market data using R to create a predictive model for year-to-date returns.
- Fun fact: before earning my BS in Web Design & Development, I taught myself web development by reading [HTML For Dummies](https://ebay.us/f7zoun). Greatest book ever (at the time).
